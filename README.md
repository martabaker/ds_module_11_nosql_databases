NoSQL Databases Homework

For this homework, I used pyMongo, MongoDB, and Pandas to create the database "uk_foods" with the collection "establishments" that held semi-structured data from a .json file. In the setup, I used Mongo to add a new item to the database, update that new item, delete all establishments from the city of Dover, and update data types for 3 different fields (latitude and longitude from strings to decimals and RatingValue from strings to integers). In the analysis, I used mongo to find variety of differnt items including: establishments with a hygiene score of 20, establishments in London with a RatingValue greater than or equal to 4, the top 5 establishments with a RatingValue of 5 sorted by lowest hygiene score that were closed to the new establishment added to the database in the setup, and how many establishments per each Local Authority had a hygiene score of 0. While answering the questions, I flattened some of the columns within a Pandas DataFrame that I had created with results from a query of mongo database. I also used an aggregation pipeline to help answer 1 of the questions.
